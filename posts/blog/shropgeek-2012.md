# Shropgeek (R)evolution 2012

On Friday I attended [Shropgeek (R)evolution](http://2012.shropgeek-revolution.co.uk/) 
(a web conference in Shrewsbury).  It was a excellent way to spend the evening, a 
friendly and fun atmosphere, with beer and interesting conversation.  There was 
a number of talks throughout the evening and plenty of time for networking / 
drinking.

On arrival, we were given some goodies, a name badge (with lanyard) and a 
Sharpie keyring, to write our names and Twitter handles (I'm 
[@intrbiz](https://twitter.com/intrbiz)) on our badges.  Followed by a trip to 
the bar to get a pint of EPA.

Neil Kinnish got the event under way with an interesting talk on 
[Shropshire Screen](http://shropshirescreen.co.uk/).  A simple site to aggregate 
rural cinema listings across Shropshire.  A neat site, which shows how easily 
WordPress can be abused to fit a wide array of needs.

The next hour allowed for some drinking and networking, a chance for me to 
catchup with a number for friends I don't get to see that often.

Next up was Jake Smith talking about the D&AD awards system they built.  It was 
a fascinating talk, even if I'm still not sure who D&AD is and the videos 
dragged on a little.  It sure looked an interesting project to have been 
involved in.  Their attitude of the project is more important than the client is 
refreshing.  Their approach of fully involving the client during the analysis 
and model stages of a project is something I agree with.

Neil Kinnish and Mike Kus followed on with a brave presentation on WorkFu and 
how/why it failed.  It's not often that people stand up and talk about how they 
failed, making it an unusual topic for a conference.  However they made some 
very interesting points.  One point which stuck was launching the least viable 
product, in order to minimise your losses in case it doesn't work.

The last talk of the evening was Paul Annett about [gov.uk](http://www.gov.uk).  
While at Shropshire I had followed the gov.uk project closely.  It was amusing 
listening to how Government has to an extent resisted gov.uk, it's good to 
finally see the government focusing on the user, for a change.  Directgov, had 
the glimmer of a good idea, just implemented utterly the wrong way.  It was 
interesting hearing aobut how gov.uk is using their design principles to 
change the fundamental workings of government.

Following the talks, a number of people hung around to socialise into the night. 
 I even got to see Paul Annett do some magic tricks.

Throughout the evening, one topic seemed to keep getting mentioned: Iterate 
quick and often.  Make it easy to deploy your application.  Listen to feedback. 
Code, test, deploy, listen and repeat.

Lastly, thanks to the [Shropgeek team](http://twitter.com/shropgeek), sponsors 
and [speakers](http://2012.shropgeek-revolution.co.uk/speakers.php) for putting 
on a great evening.  I look forward to next year
