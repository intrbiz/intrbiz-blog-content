# 50 years on

This weekend, 27th October 2012, is 50 years on from the Cuban missile crisis.  
Arguably the closest the world has come to the Mutually Assured Destruction of a 
nuclear war.

To my generation the thought of a nuclear war seems mad. It seems unimaginable, 
a relic of history.  I never lived through the events my parents did.  I never 
felt the fear that their generation did.  While, I'm interested, and somewhat 
well informed on the subject.  I'm in many ways atypical.

Yet, while the world has moved on, progressed.  Nuclear weapons are still 
reality.  Britain still has Trident II D5 missiles, stationed on board Vanguard 
class SSBNs (submarines).  Right now there is probably 16 missiles somewhere in 
the Atlantic, each with up to 14 warheads.

With tensions between the west and Iran growing.  Is the ignorance of my 
generation acceptable?  I suspect not, my generation will have to tackle these 
issues head on in the near future.

Soon a decision over Trident will need to be made.  Should we be renewing, 
extending, decommissioning our nuclear deterrent.  This is a massively complex 
decision. A question to which I don't think there is an easy answer.

I would rule out, renewing Trident.  I don't think we should be creating any 
more nuclear weapons.  But I honestly remain undecided as to whether we should 
decommission Trident.

It would be a bold move by Britain if we decided to decommission Trident.  That 
might be a good thing.

Ultimately it's probably time we had serious international accords to completely 
disarm all states with nuclear weapons and finally lay to rest the cold war.

How the Iran situation is handled has significant impact of this.  I've read 
about proposals, for an independent international Uranium bank, which could 
provide fuel for peaceful nuclear projects.

Whatever happens, we must ensure that we have an intelligent, well informed 
discussion over the issues leading to a carefully thought out decision.
