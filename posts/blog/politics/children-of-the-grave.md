# Children Of The Grave

The recent events in Turkey have reminded me how important the Utopian ideals
of the Internet are.

My Twitter timeline is alive with information about the recent protests in
Turkey; information from the frontline, it seems.  Yet I'm dismayed by the poor
coverage and distorted reporting of the events by the mainstream media.

Images speak a thousand words! I've seen images coming from Turkey that I find
nothing short of shocking, awful and absurd.  Yet I've seen little of this in
the mainstream media.

I don't want to focus on the events in Turkey, my point is orthogonal to that.

The Internet offers us a utopia where information can be freely shared.  Where
it can be shared without restriction.  Where people can communicate with each
other.  Where geography does not exist.  It is by definition transnational.  It
offers all of us freedom.

By enabling anyone to communicate, without preduice, without inference, with
anyone else.  The Internet represents the single most powerful tool humanity
has.

This power, these freedoms.  Seem even more significant given the recent events
in Turkey.  The Internet can provide me and you directly with raw information,
when it happens, where it happens.  No media organisation, what ever there
motives can compete with that.

Recent events in the UK has reignited debate over the Data Communications Bill.

My view remains unchanged, my thoughts have not been swayed one iota.  I remain
firmly opposed to any capability for Goverment to snoop on its citizens.

To paraphrase a book I recently read:


    This post is not a manifesto. There is no time for that. This is a warning


The book in question: Cypherpunks - Freedom and the future of the Internet.  It 
was a book I found emense satisfaction in reading, and a book I would reccomend 
every Internet user to read.

The Internet is humanities best chance at a transnational utopia.  Yet it is a
paradox.  It is also a transnational surveilance distopia.

The Internet's offer of free communication also offers total surveilance,
leading to totalitaian control by an elite.

Its in encumbered upon every single person whom uses the Internet to: realise
and understand their freedom and most importantly defend it.

We must not enable a minority to snoop on our activities, to ultimately
control and dominate us.  Lets us understand our freedom, lets us embrace it,
lets us be defiant.

We must not let our politicians react dispropotionally.  We cannot and must
not accept the Data Communications Bill to be even remotely considered. 
Existing powers are too wide reaching and invasive, we must fight to get these
restricted.

The title of this post, is a track by Black Sabbath.  What does Heavy Metal
have todo with politics I hear you ask.  Its merely my interpretation of the
lyrics, but I feel it embodies my point.  Even given it was composed in a
different era (has that much really changed), I feel it is still relevant.


    "Revolution in their minds - the children start to march 
     Against the world in which they have to live
     
     Show the world that love is still alive you must be brave 
     Or you children of today are 
     Children of the Grave"
