# Children Of The Grave

This is a bit of a rehash of a post I originally wrote a 18 months ago, before 
the revelations of Edward Snowden and the more recent DRIP débâcle.

We've seen time and time again, the power of the Internet in disseminating 
information, especially during chaotic times, the most recent example being 
in the Ukraine.

The Internet offers us a utopia where information can be freely shared.  Where
it can be shared without restriction.  Where people can communicate with each
other.  Where geography does not exist.  It is by definition transnational.  It
offers all of us freedom.

By enabling anyone to communicate, without prejudice, without inference, with
anyone else.  The Internet represents the single most powerful tool humanity
has.

This power, these freedoms.  Seem even more significant given the recent events.  
The Internet can provide me and you directly with raw information, when it 
happens, where it happens.  No media organisation, what ever there motives can 
compete with that.

Recent events in the UK has reignited debate over the interception and retention 
of communications data.

My view remains unchanged, my thoughts have not been swayed.  I remain firmly 
opposed to any capability for Government to snoop on its citizens.

To paraphrase a book I recently read:

    This post is not a manifesto. There is no time for that. This is a warning

The book in question: Cypherpunks - Freedom and the future of the Internet.  It 
was a book I found immense satisfaction in reading, and a book I would recommend 
every Internet user to read.

The Internet is humanities best chance at a transnational utopia.  Yet it is a
paradox.  It is also a transnational surveillance dystopia.

The Internet's offer of free communication also offers total surveillance,
leading to totalitarian control by an elite.

Its in encumbered upon every single person whom uses the Internet to: realise
and understand their freedom and most importantly defend it.

We must not enable a minority to snoop on our activities, to ultimately
control and dominate us.  Lets us understand our freedom, lets us embrace it,
lets us be defiant.

We must not let our politicians react disproportionally.  Existing powers are 
too wide reaching and invasive, we must fight to get these reduced.  But above 
all we need debate.  We cannot let politicians to collude and pass these 
draconian powers without any consultation or proper consideration.

The title of this post, is a track by Black Sabbath.  What does Heavy Metal
have to do with politics I hear you ask.  Its merely my interpretation of the
lyrics, but I feel it embodies my point.  Even given it was composed in a
different era (has that much really changed), I feel it is still relevant.


    "Revolution in their minds - the children start to march 
     Against the world in which they have to live
     
     Show the world that love is still alive you must be brave 
     Or you children of today are 
     Children of the Grave"
